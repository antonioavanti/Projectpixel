<main>
	<h2>The DOM</h2>
	<p>
		The DOM stands for "Document Object Model" and is a tree-like structure that is a representation of the HTML document, the relationship between elements, and contains the content and properties of the elements.<br><br>

		The DOM is not:<br><br>

		part of the JavaScript language<br><br>
		The DOM is:<br><br>

		<ul>
			<li>constructed from the browser</li>
			<li>is globally accessible by JavaScript code using the document object
		The DOM is used all of the time and is what we'll be using throughout this course!</li>
		</ul>

	</p>

	<h2>Select An Element By ID</h2>
	<p>
		Remember the document object is an object, just like a JavaScript object. This means it has key/value pairs. Some of the values are just pieces of data, while others are functions (also known as methods!) that provide some type of functionality. The first DOM method that we'll be looking at is the <big><b>getElementById()</b></big> method.<br>
		If we ran the code above in the console, we wouldn't get anything, because we did not tell it the ID of any element to get! We need to pass a string to .getElementById() of the ID of the element that we want it to find and subsequently return to us:<br><br>

		<big><b>document.getElementById('footer');</b></big><br><br>

		One thing to notice right off the bat, is that we're passing 'footer', not '#footer'. It already knows that it's searching for an ID (its name is "getElementById", for a reason!).
	</p>

	<h2>Selecting Multiple Elements At Once</h2>
	<h3>Accessing Elements By Their Class</h3>
	<p>
		.getElementsByClassName() is expecting that we call it with a string of the class we want it to search for/return:<br><br>

		document.getElementsByClassName('brand-color');<br><br>

		Note: CLASS = PLURAL --> .getElementsByClass()<br><br>
	</p>
	<h3>Accessing Elements By Their Tag</h3>
	<p>
		After looking at both .getElementById() and .getElementsByClassName(), the new .getElementsByTagName() method should seem quite easy on the eyes:<br><br>

		document.getElementsByTagName('p');
	</p>
	<h2>The Node Interface</h2>
	<h3>TAG-->TOKEN-->NODES-->DOM</h3>
	<p>
		Node (with a capital "N"!) is a blueprint that contains information about all of the properties and methods for real nodes (with a lowercase "n"!). If you're not used to them, the words "interface", "property", and "method" can be kind of cryptic at first. Just remember that:
		<ul>
			<li>interface = blueprint</li>
			<li>properties = data</li>
			<li>methods = functionality</li>
		</ul>

		So the Node Interface is a blueprint for all of the properties (data) and methods (functionality) that every real node has after it's been created. Now, the Node Interface has a lot of properties and methods, but it's not very specific...I mean, what _is_ a node???<br><br>

		Just like "blueprint for a Building" is not as specific as "blueprint for a house" or "blueprint for a skyscraper". These are more-specific blueprints. And these more-specific blueprints would probably have their own properties and methods that are specific to just houses or just skyscrapers.
	</p>
	<h2>Element Interface</h2>
	<p>
		Just like the Node Interface, the Element Interface is a blueprint for creating elements. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element" target="blank">Element Interface on MDN</a><br><br>

		One really important thing about the Element Interface is that it is a descendent of the Node Interface.<br><br>

		EventTarget<---Node<---Element<br><br>

		Since Element is pointing at Node, this indicates that the Element Interface inherits all of the Node Interface's properties and methods. This means that any element (lowercase "e"!) that was created from the Element Interface is also a descendent from the Node Interface...which means the element (lowercase "e"!) is also a node (lowercase "n"!).
	</p>
	<h2>The querySelector Method</h2>
	<p>
		We can use the .querySelector() method to select elements just like we do with CSS. We use the .querySelector() method and pass it a string that's just like a CSS selector:<br><br>

		// find and return the element with an ID of "header"
		document.querySelector('#header');<br><br>

		// find and return the first element with the class "header"
		document.querySelector('.header');<br><br>

		// find and return the first header element
		document.querySelector('header');
	</p>
	<h1>Updating Existing Page Content</h1>
	<br>
	<h2>An Element's Inner HTML</h2>
	<p>
		Every element inherits properties and methods from the Element Interface (remember this from the previous lesson!). This means that every element has an .innerHTML property. This property, as it's rightly named, represents the markup of the element's content. We can use this property to:<br>

		<ul>
			<li>get an element's (and all of its descendants!) HTML content</li>
			<li>set an element's HTML content</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<big><b>The .innerHTML property sets or returns the HTML content inside the selected element (i.e. between the tags).</b></big><br><br>

		Inner vs Outer<br><br>

		<!--h1 id="pick-me">Greetings To <span>All</span>!</h1-->

		const innerResults = document.querySelector('#pick-me').innerHTML;<br>
		console.log(innerResults); // logs the string: "Greetings To <!--span><br>All</span-->!"<br><br>

		const outerResults = document.querySelector('#pick-me').outerHTML;<br>
		console.log(outerResults); // logs the string: "<!--h1 <br>id="pick-me">Greetings To <span-->	All<!--/span>!</h1-->"<br>

	</p>
