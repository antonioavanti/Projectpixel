<h1>Conditionals</h1>
<h2>If...else statements</h2>
<p>
	If...else statements allow you to execute certain pieces of code based on a condition, or set of conditions, being met.<br><br>
	<b>if</b> (this expression is true) {<br>
		run this code<br>
	} <b>else</b> {<br>
		run this code<br>
	}<br>
	<h3>Example</h3>
	var a = 1;<br>
	var b = 2;<br>

	if (a > b) {<br>
  	console.log("a is greater than b");<br>
	} else {<br>
  	console.log("a is less than or equal to b");<br>
	}<br>
	Prints: "a is less than or equal to b"
</p>

<h2>Else If statements</h2>
<p>
	You're trying to decide what to wear tomorrow. If it is going to snow, then you’ll want to wear a coat. If it's not going to snow and it's going to rain, then you’ll want to wear a jacket. And if it's not going to snow or rain, then you’ll just wear what you have on.<br><br>

	var weather = "sunny"; <br><br>

	<b>If</b> (weather === "snow") { <br>
	     console.log("Bring a coat."); <br>
	} <b>else if</b> (weather === "rain") { <br>
	     console.log("Bring a rain jacket."); <br>
	} <b>else</b> { <br>
	     console.log("Wear what you have on."); <br>
	}<br>
</p>

<h2>Logical Operators</h2>
<p>
	Here’s the logical expression used to represent Julia’s weekend plans:<br><br>

var colt = "not busy";<br>
var weather = "nice";<br><br>

if (colt === "not busy" && weather === "nice") {<br>
  console.log("go to the park");<br>
}<br>
Prints: "go to the park"<br><br>

Notice the && in the code above.<br><br>

The && symbol is the logical AND operator, and it is used to combine two logical expressions into one larger logical expression. If both smaller expressions are true, then the entire expression evaluates to true. If either one of the smaller expressions is false, then the whole logical expression is false.<br><br>

Another way to think about it is when the && operator is placed between the two statements, the code literally reads, "if Colt is not busy AND the weather is nice, then go to the park".
</p>
<h2>Truthy and falsy</h2>
<p>
	Here's the list of all the falsy values:<br><br>
	<ol>
		<li>the Boolean value <big><b>false</b></big></li>
		<li>the <big><b>null</b></big></li>
		<li>the <big><b>undefined</b></big></li>
		<li>the number <big><b>0</b></big></li>
		<li>the empty string <big><b>""</b></big></li>
		<li>the odd value <big><b>NaN</b></big></li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Falsy value</h3>

	A value is falsy if it converts to false when evaluated in a boolean context. For example, an empty String "" is falsy because, "" evaluates to false. You already know if...else statements, so let's use them to test the truthy-ness of "".

	<h3>Truthy value</h3>

	A value is truthy if it converts to true when evaluated in a boolean context. For example, the number 1 is truthy because, 1 evaluates to true. Let's use an if...else statement again to test this out:
</p>
<h2>Ternary Operator</h2>
<p>
	The ternary operator provides you with a shortcut alternative for writing lengthy if...else statements.Sometimes, you might find yourself with the following type of conditional.<br><br>

	var isGoing = true;<br>
	var color;<br>

	if (isGoing) {<br>
	  color = "green";<br>
	} else {<br>
	  color = "red";<br>
	}<br><br>

	console.log(color);<br><br>

	conditional ? (if condition is true) : (if condition is false)<br><br>

	To use the ternary operator, first provide a conditional statement on the left-side of the ?. Then, between the ? and : write the code that would run if the condition is true and on the right-hand side of the : write the code that would run if the condition is false. For example, you can rewrite the example code above as:<br><br>

	var isGoing = true;<br>
	var color = isGoing ? "green" : "red";<br>
	console.log(color);<br>

</p>
<h2>Switch statement</h2>
<p>
	A switch statement is an another way to chain multiple else if statements that are based on the same value without using conditional statements. Instead, you just switch which piece of code is executed based on a value.
	<div id="statement">
		<div class="comparison">
			<h3>Else if statement</h3>
			<p>
				if (option === 1) { <br>
					  console.log("You selected option 1."); <br>
					} else if (option === 2) { <br>
					  console.log("You selected option 2."); <br>
					} else if (option === 3) { <br>
					  console.log("You selected option 3."); <br>
					} else if (option === 4) { <br>
					  console.log("You selected option 4."); <br>
					} else if (option === 5) { <br>
					  console.log("You selected option 5."); <br>
					} else if (option === 6) { <br>
					  console.log("You selected option 6."); <br>
					}
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="comparison">
			<h3>Swith statement</h3>
			<p>
				switch (option) { <br>
					  case 1: <br>
					    console.log("You selected option 1."); <br>
					  case 2: <br>
					    console.log("You selected option 2."); <br>
					  case 3: <br>
					    console.log("You selected option 3."); <br>
					  case 4: <br>
					    console.log("You selected option 4."); <br>
					  case 5: <br>
					    console.log("You selected option 5."); <br>
					  case 6: <br>
					    console.log("You selected option 6."); <br>
					}
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</p>
<h2>Falling through</h2>
<p>
	In some situations, you might want to leverage the "falling-through" behavior of switch statements to your advantage. For example, when your code follows a hierarchical-type structure.<br><br>

	var tier = "nsfw deck"; <br>
	var output = "You’ll receive "<br><br>

	switch (tier) { <br>
	  case "deck of legends": <br>
	    output += "a custom card, "; <br>
	  case "collector's deck": <br>
	    output += "a signed version of the Exploding Kittens deck, "; <br>
	  case "nsfw deck": <br>
	    output += "one copy of the NSFW (Not Safe for Work) Exploding Kittens card game and "; <br>
	  default: <br>
	    output += "one copy of the Exploding Kittens card game."; <br>
	} <br>

	console.log(output); <br><br>

	In this example, based on the successful Exploding Kittens Kickstarter campaign (a hilarious card game created by Elan Lee), each successive tier builds on the next by adding more to the output. Without any break statements in the code, after the switch statement jumps to the "nsfw deck", it continues to fall-through until reaching the end of the switch statement. <br><br>

	Also, notice the default case. You can add a default case to a switch statement and it will be executed when none of the values match the value of the switch expression.<br><br>

	var tier = "none"; <br>
	var output = "You’ll receive "; <br><br>

	switch (tier) { <br>
	  ... <br>
	  default: <br>
	    output += "one copy of the Exploding Kittens card game."; <br>
	} <br><br>

	console.log(output);
</p>

<h2>LOOPS</h2>
<h3>While loop</h3>
<p>
	Three main pieces of information that any loop should have are:<br><br>

	<big><b>When to start:</b></big> The code that sets up the loop — defining the starting value of a variable for instance.<br>
	<big><b>When to stop:</b></big> The logical condition to test whether the loop should continue.<br>
	<big><b>How to get to the next item:</b></big> The incrementing or decrementing step — for example, x = x * 3 or x = x - 1<br>
	Here's a basic while loop example that includes all three parts.<br><br>

	var start = 0; // <i>when to start</i><br>
	while (start < 10) { // <i>when to stop</i><br>
  		console.log(start);<br>
  start = start + 2; // <i>how to get to the next item</i><br>
}
</p>
<h3>For loop</h3>
<p>
	The for loop explicitly forces you to define the start point, stop point, and each step of the loop. In fact, you'll get an Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ) if you leave out any of the three required pieces.<br><br>

	for ( start; stop; step ) { <br>
  // do this thing<br>
}<br>
	Here's an example of a for loop that prints out the values from 0 to 5. Notice the semicolons separating the different statements of the for loop: var i = 0; i < 6; i = i + 1. Refer to JS file for example.<br><br>

	<h3>Increment and Decrement</h3>
	x++ or ++x // same as x = x + 1 <br>
	x-- or --x // same as x = x - 1 <br>
	x += 3 // same as x = x + 3 <br>
	x -= 6 // same as x = x - 6 <br>
	x *= 2 // same as x = x * 2 <br>
	x /= 5 // same as x = x / 5
</p>
<h1>FUNCTIONS</h1>
<p>Functions allow you to package up lines of code that you can use (and oftern reuse) in your programs.</p>
<h2>Parts of a function</h2>
<p>
	Now, to get your function to do something, you have to invoke or call the function using the function name, followed by parentheses with any arguments that are passed into it. Functions are like machines. You can build the machine, but it won't do anything unless you also turn it on. Here's how you would call the sayHello() function from before, and then use the return value to print to the console:<br><br>

	// declares the sayHello function<br>
	function sayHello() {<br>
	  var message = "Hello!"<br>
	  return message; // returns value instead of printing it<br>
	}<br>

	// function returns "Hello!" and console.log prints the return value<br>
	console.log(sayHello());<br><br>

	<big><b>Parameters vs. Arguments</b></big><br><br>
	At first, it can be a bit tricky to know when something is either a parameter or an argument. The key difference is in where they show up in the code. A <b>parameter</b> is always going to be a variable name and appears in the function declaration. On the other hand, an <b>argument</b> is always going to be a value (i.e. any of the JavaScript data types - a number, a string, a boolean, etc.) and will always appear in the code when the function is called or invoked.<br><br>

	It’s important to understand that return and print are not the same thing. Printing a value to the JavaScript console only displays a value (that you can view for debugging purposes), but the value it displays can't really be used for anything more than that. For this reason, you should remember to only use console.log to test your code in the JavaScript console.

	Paste the following function declaration and function invocation (check cupofjava2) into the JavaScript console to see the difference between logging (printing) and returning:<br><br>

	<h3>Functions as parameters (<small>refer to example in 2js</small>)</h3>
	Being able to store a function in a variable makes it really simple to pass the function into another function. A function that is passed into another function is called a callback. Let's say you had a helloCat() function, and you wanted it to return "Hello" followed by a string of "meows" like you had with catSays. Well, rather than redoing all of your hard work, you can make helloCat() accept a callback function, and pass in catSays.<br><br>

	// function expression catSays<br>
	var catSays = function(max) {<br>
	  var catMessage = "";<br>
	  for (var i = 0; i < max; i++) {<br>
	    catMessage += "meow ";<br>
	  }<br>
	  return catMessage;<br>
	};<br><br>

	// function declaration helloCat accepting a callback<br>
	function helloCat(callbackFunc) {<br>
	  return "Hello " + callbackFunc(3);<br>
	}<br><br>

	// pass in catSays as a callback function<br>
	helloCat(catSays);<br><br>

	<h3>Inline function expressions (<small>refer to example in 2js</small>)</h3><br>

	A function expression is when a function is assigned to a variable. And, in JavaScript, this can also happen when you pass a function inline as an argument to another function. Take the favoriteMovie example for instance:<br><br>

	// Function expression that assigns the function displayFavorite<br>
	// to the variable favoriteMovie<br>
	var favoriteMovie = function displayFavorite(movieName) {<br>
	  console.log("My favorite movie is " + movieName);<br>
	};<br><br>

	// Function declaration that has two parameters: a function for displaying<br>
	// a message, along with a name of a movie<br>
	function movies(messageFunction, name) {<br>
	  messageFunction(name);<br>
	}<br>

	// Call the movies function, pass in the favoriteMovie function and name of movie<br>
	movies(favoriteMovie, "Finding Nemo");<br>
	Returns: My favorite movie is Finding Nemo<br><br>

	But you could have bypassed the first assignment of the function, by passing the function to the movies() function inline.<br>

	// Function declaration that takes in two arguments: a function for displaying<br>
	// a message, along with a name of a movie<br>
	function movies(messageFunction, name) {<br>
	  messageFunction(name);<br>
	}<br>

	// Call the movies function, pass in the function and name of movie<br>
	movies(function displayFavorite(movieName) {<br>
	  console.log("My favorite movie is " + movieName);<br>
	}, "Finding Nemo");<br>
	Returns: My favorite movie is Finding Nemo<br><br>

	This type of syntax, writing function expressions that pass a function into another function inline, is really common in JavaScript. It can be a little tricky at first, but be patient, keep practicing, and you'll start to get the hang of it!<br><br>

	<h3>Why use anonymous inline function expressions?</h3>
	Using an anonymous inline function expression might seem like a very not-useful thing at first. Why define a function that can only be used once and you can't even call it by name?<br><br>

	Anonymous inline function expressions are often used with function callbacks that are probably not going to be reused elsewhere. Yes, you could store the function in a variable, give it a name, and pass it in like you saw in the examples above. However, when you know the function is not going to be reused, it could save you many lines of code to just define it inline.
